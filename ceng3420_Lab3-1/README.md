CENG3420 Lab Assignments

## Lab 3-1: Implement the Finite State Machine
* Replace all `x` in `uop` with the correct 1 or 0, according to the microarchitecture (`riscv-lc.pdf` in `docs/`) and the finite state machine (`fsm.pdf` in `docs/`).
* Implement one line code that the register x0 is hard-wired to zero in `riscv-lc.c`.
    - Once you implement the code, you can remove the code `error("Lab3-1 assignment: x0 is hard-wired to zero\n");` to make the simulator continues to work.
